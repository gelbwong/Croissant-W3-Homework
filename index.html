        Croissants are a type of pastry that originated in France. They are made
        from a leavened dough consisting of flour, water, yeast, sugar, salt,
        and butter. The dough is layered with butter, rolled, and folded several
        times in a process called laminating, which creates a flaky texture with
        many thin layers.

        The exact origin of the croissant is a matter of debate, but it is
        widely believed to have been inspired by Austrian pastries such as the
        kipferl. The modern croissant as we know it today, with its crescent
        shape, became popular in France in the 19th century.

        Croissants can be enjoyed plain or filled with various ingredients such
        as chocolate, almond paste, or ham and cheese. They are typically served
        for breakfast or as a snack, often accompanied by coffee or tea.

        In recent years, croissants have become popular worldwide and are now
        produced and enjoyed in many countries, each with its own variations and
        adaptations.
