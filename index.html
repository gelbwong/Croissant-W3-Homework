          Croissants are a type of pastry that originated in France. They are
          made from a leavened dough consisting of flour, water, yeast, sugar,
          salt, and butter. The dough is layered with butter, rolled, and folded
          several times in a process called laminating, which creates a flaky
          texture with many thin layers.
        </p>

          The exact origin of the croissant is a matter of debate, but it is
          widely believed to have been inspired by Austrian pastries such as the
          kipferl. The modern croissant as we know it today, with its crescent
          shape, became popular in France in the 19th century.

          Croissants can be enjoyed plain or filled with various ingredients
          such as chocolate, almond paste, or ham and cheese. They are typically
          served for breakfast or as a snack, often accompanied by coffee or
          tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years, croissants have become popular worldwide and are now
          produced and enjoyed in many countries, each with its own variations
          and adaptations.
